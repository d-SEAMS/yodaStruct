## 2.9.1 (2026-09-02)

- Engine pinned at seams-core v2.9.2: threaded cell-list neighbour lists.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- `cages_by_signature` on the compiled and library API: closed polyhedra by ring-size census.
- Engine pinned at seams-core v2.9.0.
- `dseams.cages_by_signature` and `core.findBySignature`: closed polyhedra from a ring-size census (`sodalite`, `4:6,6:8`; named `hc` / `ddc` through the TUM finders). Engine wrap and flake input follow seams-core `884bed86`.
- `classifyTopology` and `dseams.classify_topology` take a sequence of library texts at different hop counts and name each atom by the deepest that knows it; the result carries `depth`.
- `guestOccupancy`, `periodicCentroid` and `dseams.guest_occupancy`: guests placed in enumerated cages by the periodic centroid of each cage.
- `ionEnvironment` lists each ion's shell `members`; `shellRingCensus` and `dseams.shell_ring_census` count the rings through a shell by size.
- Engine pinned past v2.8.0 for `topo::matchLibraries`, `site::guestOccupancy` and `site::shellRingCensus`. `dseams.read` has no region and calls `readLammpsTrjO` (keeps every atom of the type, sets `inSlice`). A dump slice that shrinks `nop` is `dseams.core.readLammpsTrjreduced`. An axis with `lo == hi` is unconstrained.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- Engine wrap and flake input pinned at seams-core v2.8.0; the 2.8.0 tag carried an empty revision.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- `topologyFingerprint`, `localTopologyKey`, `topologyLibrary`, `classifyTopology` and `ionEnvironment` on the compiled surface; `dseams.fingerprint`, `dseams.topology_library`, `dseams.classify_topology`, `dseams.ion_environment` and `dseams.cages({complete = true})` in the library API; `example_lua/library/topology.lua` as a meson test.
- Lua API reference rewritten for the by-value getters, the completion argument and named keys on every table.
- Engine pinned at seams-core v2.8.0 with readcon-core v0.14.10.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- `seededCageAffiliation` takes an optional fifth argument that turns on the engine's ring completion (fill the last vertex of a six-ring whose other vertices carry a label).
- Nested-table getters (`bondNetworkByIndex`, `getPrimitiveRings`, `prismAnalysis`, `bulkRingNumberAnalysis`) take their arguments by value, so Lua tables passed straight from the helpers no longer crash the binding; `example_lua/library/legacy_chain.lua` exercises the chain.
- Engine pinned at seams-core v2.7.0.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- `subprojects/seams-core.wrap` is `v2.6.0`.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- `subprojects/seams-core.wrap` is `v2.5.0`. `calcRunningCN` binds `rdf::runningCN` (`{r, cn}`, `rhoJ = nJ / volume`). Ice-score `--family`, `seams cn --ions`, `seams pairs`, `seams domains`, and `seams density-z` live on the engine CLI.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- `subprojects/seams-core.wrap` stays `v2.4.0`. `calcRDF3D` binds `rdf::partialRdf`. `calcCN` / `dseams.cn` bind `rdf::coordinationNumber`. `neighListPair`, `parseSiteSpec`, `SiteTable`, `ionCloud`, `getHbondNetworkFromDonors`, and `donatedHydrogenBond` are on `dseams.core`. The Meson build writes a `lua.hpp` from the pkg-config 5.3/5.4 headers so sol does not pick a distro 5.5 `lua.hpp`.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- `subprojects/seams-core.wrap` is `v2.4.0`. Lua still has `neighListO`, `populateHbonds` / `populateHbondsWithInputClouds` (`getHbondNetwork` / `getHbondNetworkFromClouds`), and `calcRDF` (`rdf2D`). This library does not bind `site::`, `rdf::`, or `populateHbondsFromDonors`.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- `subprojects/seams-core.wrap` is `v2.3.1`. Remaining cutoff builders on the engine use vesin.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- `subprojects/seams-core.wrap` is `v2.3.0`. `require("dseams")` applies the engine twelve-factor table when the header is present. The docs mark is the hexagonal ice cage with a primitive ring, as SVG.

## [2.2.5] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- `subprojects/seams-core.wrap` is `v2.2.5` (linkcell v0.2.4). `dseams.knn` is unchanged.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- `subprojects/seams-core.wrap` is `v2.2.4` (linked-cell k-nearest). `dseams.knn` is unchanged. The compiled-registration page is Doxygen of `lua_api.hpp`, not a hand list.

## [2.2.2]

### Changed

- Shibuya docs from `docs/orgmode/`. The Lua surface is documented there. The compiled-registration page is Doxygen of `lua_api.hpp`.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- Flake-based Nix package for the `dseams` Lua library.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- This repository is the Lua/Fennel **library** `dseams` (`luadseams`). `require("dseams")` loads Lua helpers on `dseams_core`. There is no `yodaStruct` executable. The engine CLI is `seams` in seams-core.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- `require("yoda")` and `(require :yoda-fnl)` are the table-first helpers: `read`, `neighbors`, `knn`, `chill_plus` / `chill-plus`, `cages`. Suffix dispatch covers LAMMPS, XYZ, `.con`, and chemfiles formats when linked. `getIceTypePlusNoPrint` is registered so CHILL+ does not write a file.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- `prismAnalysis` takes `atomID` by reference so later frames keep the first-frame ID.
- `templates/{hc,ddc}.xyz` and the selection/clathrate example dumps ship in this tree.
- `shellSeparation` is registered. Fennel installs with the binary.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- First release of the `yodaStruct` CLI as its own repository. Lua and Fennel front end for the d-SEAMS C++ engine. Fennel 1.5.3 is vendored for `.fnl` scripts. The engine is [seams-core](https://github.com/d-SEAMS/seams-core). Python is [PydSEAMSlib](https://github.com/d-SEAMS/PydSEAMSlib).
